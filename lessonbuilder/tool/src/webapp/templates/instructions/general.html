	The Lessons tool allows instructors to organize the various forms of content, interaction,
	and participation within their course site and present them as a series of intuitive modules,
	or lessons, that their students may follow. By aggregating the functionality and data within
	other tools into a single place, instructors may drastically simplify the tasks required of
	their students.
